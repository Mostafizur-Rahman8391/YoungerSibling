# **YoungerSibling**

## **Overview**
YoungerSibling is a Python-based terminal utility script designed for educational purposes. It provides a set of useful tools to perform tasks like searching the web, performing lookups (Google search, IP lookup, username lookup, etc.), and extracting metadata from images, directly from the terminal. This project aims to help students, developers, and hobbyists learn about web scraping, API usage, and terminal interaction with Python.

- **Python**: The main programming language used to create the script.
- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests for data fetching.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping (specifically Google search results).
- **DNS Resolver**: For querying MX records of email domains.
- **ExifRead**: For extracting EXIF metadata from image files.
- **TerminalTables**: To display results in a neat, readable table format.
- **Colorama**: For colorizing terminal output for better readability.

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```bash
   $ python main.py
   ```
### 2. **Available Options**
After launching the script, you will be presented with a menu of options:
```bash
Choose an option:
1. Google Search
2. IP Lookup
3. Email Lookup
4. Username Lookup
5. Exif Data Extraction
6. Exit
```
- Google Search: Enter a search query, and the script will fetch and display results from Google in a table.
- IP Lookup: Provide an IP address, and the script will retrieve geolocation data like country, region, city, and ISP.
- Email Lookup: Enter an email address, and the script will display MX records for the email's domain.
- Username Lookup: Provide a username, and the script will check its presence across multiple social media platforms.
- Exif Data Extraction: Supply the path to an image file, and the script will extract and display its EXIF metadata.
